Michael scored an interview with HackerRank for an internship. However, he can't even answer the first question! Help Michael score that internship by swooping in and writing a short program that prints each number from 1 to n on a new line.

However, this program has a twist.

For each multiple of 4, print "CSESoc" instead of the number.

For each multiple of 6, print "Rocks" instead of the number.

For numbers which are multiples of both 4 and 6, print "CSESocRocks" instead of the number.

Hurry! If Michael doesn't score this internship, he's going to be unemployed :(
